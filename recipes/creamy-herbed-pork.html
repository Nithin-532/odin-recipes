  <h2>Arousing the appetite</h2>
  <p>These creamy pork chops are a delicious comfort-food meal. Serve with potatoes and your favorite vegetable.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 thick-cut boneless pork chops</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon instant beef bouillon granules</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Season pork chops on all sides with steak seasoning. Mix flour, basil, and bouillon granules together in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add seasoned chops and cook until browned and only slightly pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer chops to a plate.</li>
    <li>Add remaining butter to the skillet as needed so that about 3 tablespoons pan drippings remain. Stir pepper into pan drippings and cook for 1 minute. Add flour mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until browned, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook, stirring constantly, until thick and bubbly, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve hot sauce over pork chops.</li>
  </ol>
